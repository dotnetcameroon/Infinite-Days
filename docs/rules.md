# Rules and Tips

Welcome to the E-commerce Order Processing System Challenge! This document outlines the rules and provides tips to help you succeed in the challenge.

## Rules 🚨🚨

1. **Fork the Repository:** Start by forking this repository to your own GitHub account.

2. **Code Independently:** The challenge is designed to be completed individually. Collaboration with others is not allowed.

3. **Original Work:** Submit only your original work. Plagiarism is strictly prohibited.

4. **Personal Branch:** Your work must be on your personal branch, and never on the `main`. Your branch must be named accordingly to this pattern: `<username>-solution`.
A valid branch name would be: `djoufson-solution`

5. **Commit Changes:** Make regular commits with clear and concise commit messages as you progress through the challenge.

6. **Push Changes:** Once you've completed the challenge, push your changes to your own GitHub repository.

7. **Submit Pull Request:** Your pull request as well should be addressed to a new branch with the same convention as your working branch. `djoufson-solution` would be a valid name.

## Tips

1. **Read Carefully:** Carefully read through the provided source code, comments, and documentation before starting.
2. **Explore Beyond:** While meeting the specified requirements, feel free to explore and showcase additional features to demonstrate your skills.
3. **Unit Testing:** Write comprehensive unit tests to validate the correctness of the additional features you may add.
4. **Clear Git History:** Make regular commits with clear and concise commit messages. Maintain a clean and well-documented Git history.

## Submission Requirements

1. **Git Repository:** Submit your solution via a pull request from your forked repository to the original repository.
2. **Documentation:** Include a brief description of your implementation, any additional features, and relevant information in your pull request.

Good luck, and happy coding!
